### Setup
Clone the repository:

shell
```
git clone https://github.com/loarden/weather-app.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:

shell
```
cd weather-app
```
Install the project dependencies using npm:

shell
```
npm install
```
Obtain an API key from a weather data provider (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).

Create a .env file in the project's root directory and add the following line, replacing <API_KEY> with your actual API key:

plantext
```
REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY=<API_KEY>
```
Start the development server:

shell
```
npm start
```
Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the Weather App.

## Usage
Upon opening the Weather App, you will be presented with the current weather information for your current location if geolocation is enabled in your browser. Otherwise, you will see a search bar.

To search for weather information for a specific location, enter the location in the search bar and press Enter or click the search button.

The app will display the current weather information and a 12-hours weather forecast for the searched location.
